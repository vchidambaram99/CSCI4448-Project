# CSCI4448-Project

## Planner App
Valliappan Chidambaram

This is the repo for my project for CSCI4448, a Planner app for Android. The app allows you to create tasks and notifications for them, as well as categorize the tasks to add notifications to groups of them. The source code is in /app/src/main/java/com/vchid/planner, and most of the xml I wrote is in /app/src/main/res/layout. To install/execute this code, you can import the entire project into Android Studio and compile/execute it from there.
